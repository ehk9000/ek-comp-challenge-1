# Static Comp Challenge 1
This site is our second challenge creating a static website based off of a provided image at Turing. This time no assets or native files were provided, and we were given creative license with the copy, color scheme, and the images.

## Motivation 
This site was built using flexbox, but grid was not permitted. The motivation was to show off my foundational skills with HTML and CSS and my ability to use flexbox.
